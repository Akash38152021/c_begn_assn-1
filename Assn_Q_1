Q.1 Ans :  Computers use binary to store
 data. Not only because it's a reliable
 way of storing the data, but computers 
 only understand 1s and 0s — binary. A 
 computer's main memory consists of
 transistors that switch between high
 and low voltage levels — sometimes 5V,
 sometimes 0.

Q.2

    C) defference between system and application software

    System Software is the type of software that is the 
    interface between application software and system. 
    Low-level languages are used to write the system
    software. System Software maintains the system 
    resources and gives the path for application 
    software to run. An important thing is that without 
    system software, the system can not run. It is 
    general-purpose software. 

    Application Software is the type of software 
    that runs as per user request. It runs on the 
    platform which is provided by system software. 
    High-level languages are used to write the
    application software. It’s a specific purpose
    software. The main difference between System 
    Software
